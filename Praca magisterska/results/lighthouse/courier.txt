ID: aria-allowed-attr
Title: `[aria-*]` attributes do not match their roles
Description: Each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the `aria-*` attributes. [Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/aria-allowed-attr).
Score: 0

ID: aria-required-children
Title: Elements with an ARIA `[role]` that require children to contain a specific `[role]` are missing some or all of those required children.
Description: Some ARIA parent roles must contain specific child roles to perform their intended accessibility functions. [Learn more about roles and required children elements](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/aria-required-children).
Score: 0

ID: aria-valid-attr-value
Title: `[aria-*]` attributes do not have valid values

ID: listitem
Title: List items (`<li>`) are not contained within `<ul>`, `<ol>` or `<menu>` parent elements.

ID: object-alt
Title: `<object>` elements do not have alternate text
Description: Screen readers cannot translate non-text content. Adding alternate text to `<object>` elements helps screen readers convey meaning to users. [Learn more about alt text for `object` elements](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/object-alt).
Score: 0

ID: dom-size
Title: Avoid an excessive DOM size
Description: A large DOM will increase memory usage, cause longer [style calculations](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations), and produce costly [layout reflows](https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow).

Title: Image elements have `[alt]` attributes that are redundant text.
Description: Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice.
