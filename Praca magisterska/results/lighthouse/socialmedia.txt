ID: aria-hidden-focus
Title: `[aria-hidden="true"]` elements contain focusable descendents
Description: Focusable descendents within an `[aria-hidden="true"]` element prevent those interactive elements from being available to users of assistive technologies like screen readers.

ID: image-redundant-alt
Title: Image elements have `[alt]` attributes that are redundant text.
Description: Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice.
