ID: color-contrast
Title: Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

ID: frame-title
Title: `<frame>` or `<iframe>` elements do not have a title

Score: 0

ID: html-has-lang
Title: `<html>` element does not have a `[lang]` attribute
Description: If a page doesn't specify a `lang` attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader. If the page isn't actually in the default language, then the screen reader might not announce the page's text correctly.

ID: image-alt
Title: Image elements do not have `[alt]` attributes

ID: aria-hidden-focus
Title: `[aria-hidden="true"]` elements contain focusable descendents
Description: Focusable descendents within an `[aria-hidden="true"]` element prevent those interactive elements from being available to users of assistive technologies like screen readers.

ID: button-name
Title: Buttons do not have an accessible name
Description: When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. [Learn how to make buttons more accessible](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/button-name).

ID: image-redundant-alt
Title: Image elements have `[alt]` attributes that are redundant text.
Description: Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice.

ID: dom-size
Title: Avoid an excessive DOM size
Description: A large DOM will increase memory usage, cause longer [style calculations](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations), and produce costly [layout reflows](https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow).
